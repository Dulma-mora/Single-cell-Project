# Single-cell-Project

In this repository is uploaded the code for the scRNA Analysis project for Genomics and Transcriptomics course at Bioinformatics for Computational Genomics Master's Degree at Politecnico di Milano.

Briefly, in this script are the following steps for the scRNA analysis:

1. Cell Quality Control and QC Metrics
2. Identification of the most variable genes
3. Scaling counts and dimensional reduction (PCA) process
4. Clustering comparing UMAP and TSNE
5. Finding marker genes
6. Assigning cell types to clusters
